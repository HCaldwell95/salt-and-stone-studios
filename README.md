# Salt And Stone Studios - My Milestone Project

<img src="assets/images/responsive-test.jpg" alt="Image showing responsive test for my website" width="100%">


Welcome to my first milestone project, Salt And Stone Studios.

After ten years in the Construction Industry, I decided it was time for a change. I have always had an interest in computing and had always dreamed of having a job where I could utilise my computer skills, but the opportunity never came. Earlier this year, I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll in a Full Stack Development course.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my learning and understanding of the HTML and CSS modules that I have completed thus far and to implement them into a live project. This was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in design and development. The project is a fucntional website, built with HTML and CSS.

Below, I will outline each step of the process and my reasonings used to plan this project. I will reference my sources and highlight my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for taking the time to view my project and I truly hope you enjoy it as much as I did designing and developing it.

## UX - User Experience Design

The inspiration behind the planning of this project comes largely from my love of music and lifelong dream of establishing my on recording studio (purely for my hobbies and not for a career!). I am a musician myself and I've always been inspired by the great creatives of our generation. By thinking of the user experience through each step of this design journey, it has resulted in a more positive experience and general feel.

I have broken down the planning into the five planes:
- __The Strategy Plane__ 
- __The Scope Plane__
- __The Structure Plane__
- __The Skeleton Plane__
- __The Surface Plane__
  

## Strategy Plane

My aim as the creator of this project is to instill the inspiration that I feel towards music and companionship.

#### Creator Stories

Creator Goals
- I aim to ensure my project is easy to navigate.
- Due to my project being a mostly information-based site, I don't want my users to get lost in the text.
- As a creator, I strive to onvoke positive emotional responses from users.
- My content should be relatable. Any images, text or quotes should have purpose.
- I don't want to overload my users with information so I need to invest time into establishing a structure that works well for my project. It should ease the user in.

Once I established my strategy, the most important consideration from the user's perspective was how a user would feel going through the project.

#### User Stories

First-time visitor goals:

- As a first-time visitor, I want instant clarity about the project's purpose upon landing on the page.
- I desire effortless navigation - the ability to return to the home page quickly and a seemless way to move forward without needing to scroll back through the content.
- I hope to find reinforcement and support for the content that I am consuming through quotes, stories or images.
- I aim to experience a sense of progression while navigating the page without feeling overwhelmed or lost.
- I want to enjoy a visualy engaging experience without becoming fatigued.

Returning visitor goals

- As a revisiting user, I aim to establish contact with the creator or creators, either through social links or a dedicated contact page.
- I seek the ability to reference information sources or discover the origins of the provided content.

The user stories empower me to develop a clearer concept of the project's feature requirements and their relative priorities.

During my initial planning, I researched local studios in the area and reviewed their websites. Many of these websites overloaded their users with so much content, whereas others went in the other direction and had very minimal information about the studio and the services they provided. 

I asked my friends and fellow musicians, what elements of a music studio that they would be concerned with and their responses helped me to establish the core content for the website and where my focus should be.

## Scope Plane

Based on my strategy goals, I was able to establish that I wouldn't be able to implement everything that I had thought of and the suggestions of what users would like to see. It simply wasn't feasible for my initial release. 

The easiest solution for me to start was a minimum viable product, which would provide the core content that I had deduced from my research.

From this, I was able to split my project into three phases.

#### Phase 1 - 

- A home page with an introduction to the project, which I decided should also host the "About" content.
- A studios page where I could detail the space provided.
- A 'Meet The Team' page to introduce the team. This was an essential element as it was a consideration my fellow musicians regarded highly.
- A 'Contact Us' page, complete with a form to allow users to get in touch.

#### Phase 2 - 

- An expansion on both the 'Studios' and 'Meet The Team' pages, complete with additional images.
- Further refining of all of the styles throughout the website, allowing for consistency.

#### Phase 3 (Future Features) -
- Interactive Elements (to be implemented once I have knowledge of JavaScript)
- Light Mode/Dark Mode toggle 

Having a phased approach would allow me to release a functional website, containing all of the fundamental content that my users desire while allowing me to refine my design, better understand my flaws and collect feedback.

## Structure Plane



## Skeleton Plane

## Surface Plane

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement NOT REQUIRED 

- Another feature idea

## Testing MOST IMPORTANT - EVERYTHING NOT MENTIONED WILL BE IGNORED. BREAKDOWN PROJECT SIMILAR TO FEATURES AND EXPLAIN HOW IT HAS BEEN TESTED. TEST RESPONSIVENESS AND EFFECTS ETC SOCIAL MEDIA TO NEW PAGE AND CORRECT SITE - 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing DONE LIGHTHOUSE (IF)

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs NO SITE BREAKING BUGS IS FINE - NOTE FINDINGS

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

## Other General Project Advice

#### CodeAnywhere

I encounted multiple issues with this IDE. From losing my progress on multiple occasions to workspaces simply being corrupt and unable to open. Part way through the project, I switched over to GitPod. This left me with concerns that my git commits may not be consistent.

#### GitHub

During this project, my account was migrated to a Code Institute student account. All of my repositories and access remained, but when reviewing the git logs, there is a difference shown between my profile during this stage. Both profiles share the name of HCaldwell95, but at first glance it appears that the git commits come from another user. I can confirm that all commits have been from myself and no other user has ever accessed my project. I believe this is due to the account migration.
